/**
 * TIP: Creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of your app.
There should only be a single store in your app.

 * IMPORTANT: Don't use this method with Server Side Rendering. If
 * your app is using SSR, and you do this, youâ€™ll end up with a
 * SINGLE store for all of your users. Almost definitely not what you want.
